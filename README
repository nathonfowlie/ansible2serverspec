#Ansible 2 ServerSpec
Helper utility to simplify synchronising configuration information that is
shared between Ansible playbooks, and Serverspec infrastructure tests.

The utility is designed to mimic the ```ansible-playbook``` command as closely as
possible, to minimise the learning curve and enable easy integration into
existing build or deployment scripts.

## Installation
```
pip install ansible2serverspec
```


### Installing from Source
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python setup.py install
```
